# This configuration writes aggregated metrics to disk under the
# /var/ubbagent/reports directory. Two metrics are written:
# * requests - Some number of "requests". This metric should be
#     reported to the agent's HTTP endpoint by an external source.
# * instance-seconds - the number of seconds that the agent (and
#     the associated metered software) has been running. Reports
#     for this metric are automatically generated by the
#     "instance-seconds" source at intervals of 10 seconds.

# The metrics section defines the metric names and types that the agent
# is configured to record.
metrics:
- name: requests
  type: int

  # The endpoints section of a metric defines which endpoints the metric data
  # is sent to.
  endpoints:
  - name: disk

  # The aggregation section indicates that reports that the agent receives for
  # this metric should be aggregated for a specified period of time prior to
  # being sent to the reporting endpoint.
  aggregation:
    bufferSeconds: 10

- name: instance-seconds
  type: int
  # The empty passthrough second indicates that no aggregation should occur for
  # this metric. Reports received are immediately sent to the reporting
  # endpoint. Passthrough is used for this metric since its only source is a
  # `heartbeat` which sends at a configured interval of 10 seconds.
  passthrough: {}
  endpoints:
  - name: disk

# The endpoints section defines where metering data is ultimately sent.
# Currently supported endpoints include:
# * disk - some directory on the local filesystem
# * servicecontrol - Google Service Control:

# metric at a defined interval.
